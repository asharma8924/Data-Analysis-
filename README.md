In this experiment, the frequentist interpretation of probability predicts that as the
number of tosses increases, the relative frequency of obtaining exactly 7 heads will
approach the true probability of X = 7, which is 0.1934. By simulating 1,000,000
repetitions of the experiment in R, we observed that the relative frequency of obtaining
exactly 7 heads approached the true probability of 0.1934 as the number of repetitions
increased. This supports the frequentist interpretation of probability, as the relative
frequency of obtaining exactly 7 heads in 12 tosses approached the true probability of X
= 7 as the number of repetitions increased, in accordance with the law of large
numbers.
Yes, our observations match up with the law of large numbers as the sample mean
will approach the true population mean..
